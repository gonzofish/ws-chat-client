# WebSocket Chat Client

A client to work with the [WebSocket Chat Server]() I wrote. This client
will ask users to login until they pick a username that doesn't exist.
After which they will be able to send chat messages.

If the user refreshes the page or navigates away, the username they picked
will be made available.
