# WebSocket Chat Client

A client to work with the [WebSocket Chat Server](https://github.com/gonzofish/ws-chat-server)
I wrote. This client will ask users to login until they pick
a username that doesn't exist. After which they will be able
to send chat messages.

If the user refreshes the page or navigates away, the username
they picked will be made available.

## Install

To install run

```shell
npm i
```

And to run the server

```shell
npm start
```
